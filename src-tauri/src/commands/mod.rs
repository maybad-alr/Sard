/// thread and freezes the ENTIRE native window until it returns (LESSONS, threading: the RAWY-183 and
/// RAWY-188 scars). `async` dispatches it to the runtime's worker pool instead, so the window stays
/// live while a 24 MP photo is processed.
///
/// The body contains NO `.await`, matching `tts_synthesize`'s shape — so nothing non-`Send` (the
/// `MutexGuard` over the connection) is ever held across an await point.
/// Import AND bind in one call. Deliberately not two: a bare import leaves the row unreferenced, and
/// the GC that runs on any surface bind would collect the image the user just chose (verified in
/// `tests/backgrounds.rs`). Binding inside the same call closes that window by construction.
///
/// RAWY-FINAL: the heavy stage now runs with NO DB LOCK HELD.
///
/// `async` was already right and is unchanged. What was wrong is that the body took `state.db.lock()`
/// and then ran decode + Lanczos3 + PNG encode while holding it. That is the app's ONLY connection,
/// and every other DB command is SYNCHRONOUS — so the main thread blocked on the mutex for the whole
/// resample and the window froze regardless of this command being off-thread. The stages are now:
///   1. `prepare`   — read + sniff + probe + content id, NO lock;
///   2. dedup check — a BRIEF lock, so an already-managed image costs no decode at all;
///   3. `materialize` — decode, luma, resample, PNG-encode into memory, NO lock;
///   4. commit+bind — ONE lock for the file writes, the INSERT, the surface binding and the GC.
///
/// Step 4 is indivisible on purpose: `gc()` collects any file in `backgrounds/` that no row names, so
/// writing the managed copy with the lock released would let a concurrent bind delete the image the
