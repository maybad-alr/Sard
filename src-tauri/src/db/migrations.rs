//! Versioned migration runner (RAWY-08).
//!
//! Each applied migration is recorded as its own row in `schema_migrations`. On each launch we apply
//! every migration whose version is **absent** from that table, each in its own transaction. Never
//! edit an already-shipped migration — append a new one instead.
//!
//! # Why presence, and not a high-water mark
//!
//! This runner used to apply migrations whose version exceeded `MAX(version)`. That encodes
//! "everything below this line is done", which is a claim two branches developing in parallel cannot
//! both make truthfully — and it fails **silently**, because a skipped migration and an applied one
//! leave identical evidence behind: nothing. It was not hypothetical. Two branches both took 17, and
//! on every database that had seen the other branch the second feature's table was simply never
//! created, against a binary that compiled and passed its tests.
//!
//! Presence-tracking removes the ordering problem entirely: a migration is applied on its own
//! account, whatever else has run, so two branches converge on the same schema in either merge order
//! and nothing ever needs renumbering.
//!
//! Re-running is not a risk despite most migrations being non-idempotent (`ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN`
//! cannot be guarded in SQLite). A migration's SQL and its `schema_migrations` row are written in the
//! SAME transaction, so a migration cannot be applied without being recorded — absent therefore
//! provably means never applied.
//!
//! # Numbering: UTC `YYYYMMDDHHMMSS`
//!
//! Presence-tracking fixes the ORDER; unique numbers fix the IDENTITY. Both are needed — if two
//! branches pick the same number, presence-tracking skips the second just as silently as before.
//!
//! Allocate a new migration's version with:
//!
//! ```text
//! date -u +%Y%m%d%H%M%S
//! ```
//!
//! and name the file after it, e.g. `20260816112700_add_shelf_colour.sql`. UTC, not local time: local
//! time repeats an hour every autumn and disagrees between contributors. Versions 1–19 predate this
//! convention and keep their hand-assigned numbers forever; `LAST_SEQUENTIAL_VERSION` is the boundary.
//!
//! The rules are enforced by the tests at the bottom of this file — unique versions, valid
//! timestamps, pinned shipped versions, and file/list agreement — and CI runs them on every pull
//! request. See `docs/WORKFLOW.md` for the contributor-facing version of this.
//!
//! # The one rule this buys with a constraint
//!
//! Migrations may be applied OUT OF NUMERIC ORDER. A database that took a migration from one branch
//! will later apply a lower-numbered one from another. **Every migration must therefore stand on its
//! own** and must not assume that a lower-numbered migration has already run. In practice migrations
//! from independent branches touch independent tables, which is what makes this safe — but it is a
//! rule, not an accident.
//!
//! `PRAGMA user_version` mirrors the COUNT of applied migrations, not the newest version number: it
//! is a 32-bit field, and a `YYYYMMDDHHMMSS` version overflows it silently to 0. Nothing in Sard
//! reads it. `db::schema_version()` returns the highest applied version, which is the value that
//! identifies *which* migration is newest.
