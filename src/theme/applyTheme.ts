// RAWY-256 — `--read-marker` / `--read-marker-quiet`: the FIRST token in Sard guaranteed LEGIBLE against
// the chrome ground. `--accent` is NOT that token in every theme — MEASURED across all 16: accent vs
// `--chrome-bg` is only 2.79:1 in Parchment, and `--muted` is 2.83:1 in Linen, both under the 3:1 floor
// (WCAG 1.4.11, non-text UI). Alpha cannot rescue either: a colour composited at partial alpha over the
// ground always lands BETWEEN the ground and the colour, so full strength IS the ceiling (verified over 816
// composites — zero counterexamples). They are TOKEN-CEILING failures, not alpha failures.
// RESOLUTION: keep the source colour when it already clears the floor; otherwise BLEND IT TOWARD `--text`
// in 5% steps and stop at the FIRST step that clears — so each theme keeps as much of Sard's terracotta
// identity as it can, instead of the marker turning flatly grey. Computed ONCE per theme change (not per
// row), so a future theme is correct on arrival and any later feature needing a legible mark on chrome can
// reuse the token. Per-theme override tables were rejected: unmaintainable AND arithmetically insufficient.
// MEASURED RESULT: 30 of 32 cells need NO blend; only Parchment/accent (10% → 3.14) and Linen/quiet
// (5% → 3.02) blend at all.

// `--muted` gets the SAME guarantee, for the same reason and by the same mechanism.
//
// The note above already recorded the symptom — "`--muted` is 2.83:1 in Linen" — but only the marker
// was floored; the token itself shipped unfloored, and `--muted` is what paints secondary TEXT in
// ~200 places (shelf labels, counts, chapter lines, tab labels, card subtitles). MEASURED across all
// 16 themes against the three grounds it actually sits on (`chromeBg` / `paperBg` / `surfaceBg`):
// SIX are below 3.0 — sepia 2.61, linen 2.68, rosequartz 2.84, sage 2.89, parchment 2.89, ivory 2.92.
// Every dark theme already clears it (3.59–6.97), as does `ink` (8.95). So this is not a light-theme
// redesign: it is six values that never met the floor the project already set for de-emphasised
// colour (`READ_MARKER_FLOOR` here, `FAINT_FLOOR` in background.ts — both 3.0).
//
// 3.0 and NOT 4.5 is deliberate: 3.0 is Sard's decided floor for de-emphasised colour, and `--muted`
// exists to be quieter than `--text`. Forcing AA-for-normal-text onto it would erase the hierarchy it
// is there to express. MEASURED effect of the floor: 6 themes blend (five at 5%, sepia at 15%), 10
// are untouched, and the floored themes keep 2.37–3.74 muted/text separation — MORE than moonlit
// (2.04) or ink (1.88) already ship with, so the ladder is preserved, not flattened.
