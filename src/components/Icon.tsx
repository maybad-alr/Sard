// The icon set — one drawing system for the marks that were previously text glyphs.
//
// WHY this exists (measured 2026-08-19, Library + Profiles only; the Reader was not sampled):
// 69 glyph-icons were rendering in FOUR typefaces, none of them the app's own —
//   Cambria Math (a maths font) ....... 36   caret, ellipsis, search, most of the settings nav
//   Segoe UI Symbol ................... 7    close, grip, gear
//   MS PGothic (a Japanese font) ...... 1    the "about" mark
//   Amiri / IBM Plex Sans ............. text, not icons
// The engine picks the face per CODEPOINT from the OS fallback chain, so weight and optical size
// are decided by whichever font happens to own that character on that machine. All three fallback
// faces are Windows-specific, so the same marks resolve differently on macOS and Linux.
//
// Geometry follows Stage 3: a 24x24 view box, `currentColor`, round caps and joins, and
// `--icon-stroke` (1.75) rather than the 1.9/2 that inline SVG in the reader currently varies over.
// Size comes from the `--icon-*` tokens, never a raw px.
//
// NOT covered here, deliberately: the eight `gs-nav-ico` marks. Those glyphs are arbitrary
// stand-ins for their sections -- the bookmark row is a triangle, the language row is the command
// symbol, the presence row is a filled circle -- so replacing them means CHOOSING NEW IMAGERY,
// which is a design decision and not a rendering fix. They are recorded in the checklist as
// needing that decision before any swap.

  // ---- the five library formats -----------------------------------------------------------
  // Each is a MINIATURE OF ITS OWN LAYOUT, drawn from the rendered view rather than from the
  // word. What they replaced were CSS gradients on a 12px box: `grid` and `covers` were the
  // same string character for character, `spines` and `details` were stripes turned two ways,
  // and `vista` was a dot. Three of the five could not have been told apart by anyone.

  | "viewVista"    // a framed scene with books standing in it
  // ---- settings navigation ----------------------------------------------------------------
  // These replace MEANING, not shape. The old marks were stand-ins picked for what characters
  // existed, so four were already apt (appearance, book styles, activity, about) and three said
  // something else entirely: the bookmark row was a triangle, the language row was the command
  // symbol, the profiles row was a diamond. Each is drawn from what its section actually holds,
  // read from the section body rather than from the glyph.
  | "appearance"   // "Appearance"     — day / night / auto        (was U+25D1)

  // The second sweep found marks the audit's list never named. They are UI controls, not text, and

  // and the 63px empty-state quotation ornament declares `Literata, serif` but actually renders in
  // Segoe UI Symbol, because Literata has no such codepoint.

  // The ⋯ menu named its actions in words alone. These give each one a mark, drawn in the same

 * a stated job — 1.2 hairline, 1.3 rule (type), 1.6 structure repeated, 1.75 structure primary,
 * 1.9 object, 3.0 ink contained, 4.2 ink solo — and seven of its ten icons genuinely need more than
 * one. A global override collapses the shelf's four volumes into a bar and REQ-09's graded specimen
 * into three identical rules, which is precisely what the icon is about.
 *
 * So for these, `strokeWidth` is omitted at the `<svg>` and every child declares its own. Everything

     Read off the rendered views, not off their names, and the differences between them are the
     differences between the layouts:

       COVERS   groups larger covers UNDER SHELF HEADINGS, inside a case card. The heading rule is
                what makes this icon not the grid one.
       GRID     is one ungrouped, edge-to-edge matrix with no headings at all. Its identity is the
                REGULARITY, so it is drawn as an even lattice with nothing above it.
       SPINES   stands books on a shelf, and real spines differ in height and in width. The
                unevenness is the whole mark; a row of equal bars would be a barcode.
       DETAILS  is a row of: thumbnail, title, quieter sub-line. Drawn literally.
       VISTA    is the only one that is a PICTURE WITH BOOKS IN IT, so it is the only one drawn as
                a frame, and the only one carrying a horizon.

  /* ---- THE TWO HALVES OF REFERENCES & REPLACEMENTS -------------------------------------------
     WHY THESE ARE NOT THE `mark` DRAWINGS. The first attempt used `markReference` and a sibling drawn
     in its language — two short type-rules and a bracket. Measured in the running app at the size the
     tab actually uses: the whole mark came to a 10px line, a 3.5px curve and nothing else inside a
     14px box. It was painting correctly and it was still, in practice, no icon at all.
     `markReference` is right where it stands alone and large; a tab needs what the `nav` family does
     — FEW SHAPES THAT FILL THE BOX at 1.6-1.9, which is why navBookmarks reads at a glance and a
     hairline bracket does not. So these are drawn to the nav family's spans (roughly 4.5-19.5 across
     and 5.5-18.7 down) and its weights, and they sit in that family's part of the union. */

 * drops to three volumes, the spread loses its gutter, the bracket loses its serifs, the reference
 * twins become single marks, the card loses its mount, the specimen drops to two rules and the
 * window loses its page outline. Both drawings keep the 24x24 viewBox, so the swap changes nothing
 * about layout or alignment.

  // 14: it was both the smallest and the least distinct thing on the bar, on the one control that

  //
  // So the small drawing carries FEWER, SHORTER, ATTACHED teeth on a rim that owns the weight, and a
  // SOLID hub instead of a second outline. Six teeth rather than eight: at this size the gaps do more
  // work than the teeth, and six of them survive where eight blur together. Same 24 viewBox as the
