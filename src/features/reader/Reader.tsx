   *     t=481ms — 182ms of the wrong colour, on every cold open.
   *   · THE BLEED. Correcting it meant writing the READING palette onto `:root`, where 31 Reader
   *     chrome rules read `--paper-bg` as the ink that contrasts with the accent. The book's paper
   *     became the colour of the highlight button and the read-aloud control.
   *
   * Setting it ALWAYS, from the resolved reading theme, ends both: the page is right on its first
   * paint because there is nothing to fall through to, and `:root` is left to the Library. A
   * per-book `pageColor` still wins — it is the same slot, written last.
