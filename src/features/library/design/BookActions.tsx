// THE ⋯ MENU ON A BOOK — one implementation, for every surface that draws one.
//
// It lived inside `BookTile`, which is fine while Vista, Covers and Spines are the only places a
// book is drawn. Grid draws a `BookCard` instead, so it inherited none of it: its ⋯ was a single
// button wired straight to Sard's older editor, and the reader met a different set of actions and a
// different editor depending only on which format they happened to be looking at. Edit details,
// Open in folder and Mark read simply did not exist there.
//
// That is the shape of the problem rather than one instance of it: a user concept — "what can I do
// with this book" — implemented once per view drifts once per view. Owned here, an action added is
// added everywhere, and a format can differ in how it LOOKS without differing in what it can do.
//
// What this does not own is the editor. It raises `onEditDetails`, and the owner decides what that
// opens, so there is exactly one answer to that question too.
