              THE MARK NEVER READ THE SHELF'S INK. It was `--faint` in both states, and its own
              note here said so — so `shelf_set_ink`, the `InkPicker` in the shelf's ⋯ menu and

              a colour could be chosen, was written, survived a reload, and was drawn by nothing.
              Measured before this line existed — the ink stored as #8DC3BA, and zero elements in
              the whole document carrying it.

              Colouring the mark is the treatment the app already uses for a shelf's ink, in the
              move-a-book menu and in the case picker; both fill a small square with

              correction stopped being the colour the reader picked, which was the only thing it
              was for. What has changed is its JOB. It used to be a speck floating inside the row;
              it is now the fixing the board sits on, springing from the group's own rail — so the
              colour reads as this shelf's identity rather than as one more dot in a column, and a
              shelf without one simply shows the same hairline the rail is made of.

            only way to make a shelf, and the group's own comment said as much ("the ONLY way to make
            one"). A creation action cannot depend on whether a list happens to be open.
            IT WAS NEVER THAT GROUP'S ACTION EITHER, and its own handler says so: it creates the shelf
            in the CURRENT SCOPE's case when the reader is standing in one, and a loose shelf only when
            they are not. That is a Library-level action that had been filed under one of the places it
            can write to.
            So both actions stand together at the end of the tree, after the places and before the
            foot: the cases, then the shelves outside them, then the two ways to add either. Nothing

            Four buttons stood here, one per authored step, and they were the only sizes a reader
            could ask for: measured on a 1680px pane Covers reached 12, 9, 8 and 6 books to a row,
            so ten and eleven could not be had at all. The steps are now anchors on a continuum
            (`atDensity`) rather than the only places to stand, and this is the control for it.

            IT IS A NATIVE RANGE, which is what a slider already is everywhere else in Sard —
            `.gs-slider` is `accent-color: var(--accent)` over the platform control and nothing
            more. That also buys RTL for free: RAWY-65 records that a native range mirrors itself.

            The two bars are the ones the four buttons drew, kept as the small and large ends, so
            the control reads as the same family rather than a generic slider dropped into the
            toolbar. They are `aria-hidden` — the range carries the accessible name.

            GRID IS INCLUDED NOW. It was excluded because it never read density at all: its CSS
            said `minmax(148px, 1fr)`, a hardcoded floor which is exactly `DENSITY_WIDTHS[2]`.
            Measured, all four steps drew an identical 179px card. That was a wiring gap, not a
            decision. DETAILS is still out, and that one IS a decision: it is a row list, and cover
            size is not what organises it. */}
