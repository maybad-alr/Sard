// Everything it edits is stored the way RAWY-19 already stored a cover fit: as a row in
// `metadata_overrides`, never a rewrite of the source EPUB. Clearing a control returns the book
// to what Sard derives for it rather than to a second stored default.

 * rectangle — it overlapped the controls beneath it, it had to guess which way to open, and its
 * relationship to the button that summoned it was something the reader had to infer from proximity.
 *
 * Opening IN THE FLOW removes all of that. There is no anchoring, no collision, no stacking order
 * and no way for it to escape the dialog, because it is inside the dialog's own column and the
 * dialog scrolls it like everything else. What is left to design is the only thing that mattered:
 * the hierarchy.
 *
 * CABINET → SHELF, IN SARD'S OWN IDIOM. The sidebar already draws this relationship — a cabinet
 * with its ink, and its shelves indented off a rail beneath it — so the chooser draws it the same
 * way rather than inventing a second grammar for the same fact. A flat list of shelf names with a
 * heading above them, which is what this was, reads as one column of equals: «روايات» sat in the
 * same place and nearly the same weight as «test1» underneath it.
 *
 * The ink dot is what finally separates two shelves called «المفضّلة»: they hang off different
 * rails, under different colours.

              Two questions, asked in order and answered in two different shapes.

              «أين يوجد الكتاب؟» is a fact, so it is a list: one row per shelf, the shelf named
              plainly with its cabinet quietly beneath it. «أين يمكن أن يوضع؟» is an action, so it
              is one button that opens a list of destinations — not a wall of them laid out on the
              panel. Those were four rows of chips competing for the same glance: the cabinet row,
              the shelf row, the category row and an add row that grew one chip per shelf in the
              library. A reader had to decode which row meant «where it is» and which meant «where
              it could go», and the two were drawn identically.

              Nothing a row shows is a destination, and nothing the button offers is already held.
              That is the whole distinction, and it is now carried by shape rather than by wording. */}

            An editor owes a reader two endings. Save writes only what changed; Cancel throws the
            buffer away and leaves the book as it was. Shelf moves and image choices have already
            been applied — they move files and memberships, which a buffer cannot hold honestly —
            so the footer says which of its changes are still pending. */}
