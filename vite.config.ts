// HOW PRODUCT CODE NAMES THE INSTRUMENTATION.
//
// Product code imports `@diag`, `@pdfDiag` and `@renderDiag` — BARE specifiers, not relative paths,
// and that is the whole point. `tsconfig.json` maps each to a two-entry fallback list, real module
// first and `diagOff.ts` second, so the typechecker follows the same substitution the bundler does:
// on `develop` it finds the real module, and on `main` — where the production tree does not carry the
// instrumentation at all — it falls back to the stub. TypeScript only applies `paths` to bare
// specifiers, never to `./diag`, which is why the specifiers had to change.
//
// This was found the hard way: the v1.2.0 release failed in CI because `npm run build` runs
// `tsc` BEFORE Vite, and the typechecker cannot resolve an import whose file the production tree
// legitimately excludes. The bundler alias alone was never enough.

// a plugin that is never omitted; only the SUBSTITUTION stays conditional.

// a sibling inside src/lib spells it. One unmatched import pulled the entire subsystem back into the
// release bundle (682 KB instead of 646 KB, every marker present) while the config still looked
// correct. A rule about text can be evaded by rewording; a rule about the file on disk cannot, so

// comparison answers a question nothing in the running app could answer during the 2026-08-07
